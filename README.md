# DotPlot3D

Welcome to DotPlot3D - **A Novel Data Visualisation Tool for Nucleotide Sequences**

DotPlot3D is a tool that expands on existing dot plot methodology and creates an output for three sequences in an interactive, user-friendly interface.  In comparison to other methods, this  allows for expansion beyond pairwise alignment, provides different colour and sizing for the generated points to reduce noise, and easily identifies regions of interest and synteny between sequences. The repository contains the dot plot tool, as well as a supplementary table that acts as a precursor step before conducting analyses. A working version can be downloaded and accessed through this repository.

The following tools are available:
- An analysis table that can be downloaded to view regions of similarity before using the DotPlot3D tool. This includes a comparison at each position to highlight areas of comparison that might be used within the dot plot tool
- Traditional dot plot tool, with comparison of three sequences. This does not include varying size
    - Added features for transition/transversion, and synonymous/synonymous sites: extension to tradition tool for further analysis.

Please download the supplementary mannual for detailed instructions on how to use features of the code. Happy DotPlotting!
